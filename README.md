# Hello Godot drone Workshop XR

A 45-minute beginner-friendly workshop on creating games in XR with Godot.

> üöß I need to keep this workshop easy. But I am learning it is going to be a bit drafty if I can say.

I was asked to host a workshop to promote a training center that teaches XR.

At first, I wanted people to play a well-known XR game. But building one in Unity?
Just opening the editor and setting everything up would take the whole workshop.

Then I discovered how simple it is to make XR games in Godot‚Äîand I fell in love üíò.

So‚Ä¶ here it is: **How to make a drone game in just 45 minutes.**

Written by a total beginner who knew nothing about Godot... yet.
