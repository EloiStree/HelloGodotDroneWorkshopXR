Super easyâ€”barely an inconvenience ðŸ˜‰

I was asked to host a workshop to promote a training center that teaches XR.

At first, I wanted people to play a well-known XR game. But building one in Unity?
Just opening the editor and setting everything up would take the whole workshop.

Then I discovered how simple it is to make XR games in Godotâ€”and I fell in love ðŸ’˜.

Soâ€¦ here it is: **How to make a drone game in just 45 minutes.**

Written by a total beginner who knew nothing about Godot... yet.
